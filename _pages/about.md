I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, currently working at Shopfully. In 2024, I joined <a href="https://www.airbus.com/">Airbus Defence and Space</a> as a Machine Learning Engineer, working on cutting-edge aerospace projects.

I earned both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees (cum laude) from the University of Trento in 2022 and 2024, respectively.

With a particular keenness for open source, I took part in the [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/t87xbcg2) as a software developer for the [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). I had the privilege of serving as a mentor at the University of Tennessee, as part of the [Google Award for Inclusion](https://research.google/outreach/air-program/). Over the years, I have actively contributed to diverse open source projects, including contributions to [NASA FPrime](https://github.com/nasa/fprime), [DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate), [Data & Analytics Framework](https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/), fueling my dedication to pushing the boundaries of innovation through collaborative endeavors.

> *I believe that machines, empowered by artificial intelligence and fueled by data, hold the potential to unlock new frontiers of human knowledge.*
