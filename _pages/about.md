I am a Student at the University of Trento currently undertaking my master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. I believe that machines, empowered by artificial intelligence and fueled by data, hold the potential to revolutionize lives, driving innovation, and unlocking new frontiers of human knowledge.

With a particular keenness for open source, I took part in the [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/t87xbcg2) as a software developer for the [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). Moreover, I had the privilege of serving as a mentor for four students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as part of the [Google Award for Inclusion](https://research.google/outreach/air-program/). Over the years, I have actively contributed to diverse projects, including contributions to [NASA FPrime](https://github.com/nasa/fprime), [DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate), [Data & Analytics Framework](https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/), fueling my dedication to pushing the boundaries of innovation through collaborative endeavors.
