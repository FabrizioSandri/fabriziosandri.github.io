<p>The conclusion of this long and magnificent experience of GSOC, which began around five months ago, has arrived, and it is now time to recap the points of this long journey. I knew from the first day that this was going to be a fantastic experience, but I never expected to learn so much this summer!</p>

<p>It all started some months ago when my thesis supervisor advised that I engage in this initiative that Google has been doing for several years. My thesis supervisor put me in touch with a PhD student at the University of Trento who had previously participated in GSOC and is now a mentor. Fascinated by his experience, I set out to work to ensure that my proposal was chosen. After several weeks of effort, I submitted my project idea, and on May 20, I received an email informing me that I had been accepted for GSOC 2022; I was overjoyed!</p>

<h2 id="gsoc-work">GSOC work</h2>
<p>The first three weeks of work, known as the Community Bonding period, have been a chance for me to study and become familiar with the tools that I would be using for the next ten weeks. This period was really beneficial to me since I was able to immerse myself into the R community while also learning a lot of new topics thanks to my blog posts: writing them helped me keep track of everything I had been studying.</p>

<p>In accordance with the <a href="https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2022/wiki/RcppDeepState#details-of-your-coding-project">goal of my project</a> I’ve been working on two distinct repositories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState">FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState</a> : the RcppDeepState package implementation, which runs fuzz testing with Valgrind and DeepState;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState-action">FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState-action</a> : Implementation of the GitHub action that allows developers to execute RcppDeepState on GitHub-hosted Rcpp-based packages. The action is also available on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rcppdeepstate">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of my progress on the two aforementioned repositories is documented in the pull requests and issues listed underneath. Furthermore, the week summaries that I posted at the end of each week give a more detailed explanation of the changes that I made week by week; you can find them <a href="https://fabriziosandri.github.io/gsoc-2022-blog/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>There’s still a lot to accomplish with RcppDeepstate, and I’m specifically talking to the fact that a future step would be the package’s release on CRAN. As the goal of my project, I spent a lot of time during the GSOC improving RcppDeepState for a future CRAN publication, but with all of the problems related to Deepstate portability on Windows-based systems, I believe that this is a future step, as demonstrated by the results obtained after uploading the package on Win-builder: most of the errors were caused by the use of a Windows system.</p>

<p>Another step would be to expand RcppDeepState’s datatype coverage by introducing additional datatypes, allowing RcppDeepState to run on a broader range of packages. To do this, I created a wiki article that describes how to <a href="https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState/wiki/Add-a-new-datatype-to-RcppDeepState">Add a new datatype to RcppDeepState</a>. The scope of this page has been successfully shown thanks to Dr.Martin R. Smith’s first external contribution to the RcppDeepState package. More information is available in the <a href="https://fabriziosandri.github.io/gsoc-2022-blog/github%20action/2022/09/02/beta-test-summary.html">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Another future improvement would be to provide a new option to RcppDeepState-action that allows users to choose a different fuzzer than the default one provided by Deepstate; Libfuzzer, Manticore and Angr are three alternative fuzzers.</p>

<h2 id="my-gsoc-experience">My GSOC experience</h2>
<p>My gsoc experience was incredible, something I never imagined, and it was one of the best in my career. This experience taught me a lot about working with others and contributing to open source. At the end of this experience, I can certainly say that I will spend more time to open source than the time I’ve spent so far. As a maintainer, I will continue to contribute to my project.</p>

<p>I am grateful to all of my mentors who took the time to guide me through this journey and share their unique experience and knowledge with me. Special thanks go to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>my evaluating mentor Dr.Toby Dylan Hocking, who has always been available to help me during the Google Summer of Code. I was able to stay on track and keep up the good work thanks to his helpful guidance.</li>
  <li>my mentor Randy Lai, who helped me with his great experience with GitHub Actions to improve the RcppDeepState action;</li>
  <li>my mentor Anirban Chetia, who gave me good suggestions on the challenges I had in the early stages of utilizing RcppDeepState;</li>
  <li>Dr.Martin R. Smith, for his great availability to beta test my GitHub action on his packages and for integrating a new datatype to RcppDeepState;</li>
  <li>all of the R community people I’ve interacted with on GitHub, the RcppCore team;</li>
  <li>Google/GSOC for organizing this fantastic event year after year.</li>

<p>Beta testing is the process of evaluating a software prototype right before its
release in order to detect flaws. This procedure can be appropriately conducted 
by a third party who is using the program for the first time, the beta tester. 
It’s important to note that the most important part of this phase is observing 
the user’s interactions with the program without any input from the developers 
in order to identify the most critical sections that need to be handled.</p>

<p>Thanks to my mentor, I was able to take part in several live beta testing 
sessions where I was the observer and my mentor was the beta tester. The main
goal of this session was to uncover weaknesses and difficulties in the technique
for configuring RcppDeepState-action. As an observer, I couldn’t participate;
all I could do was take notes on potential difficulties. This session showed me 
that no matter how much time I spent looking for bugs in the code I wrote, I
would never find them in a short period of time; beta testing, on the other 
hand, allowed me to rapidly detect flaws.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-strategy">A new strategy</h2>
<p>Live sessions are extremely beneficial, but they are not the only strategy to 
beta test the code. Another possibility for speeding up the process on a large 
scale is to use automated techniques to test the code and compare the results to
others that we already have access to. This is exactly what I talked about in my
earlier blog post about beta testing RcppDeepState-action on GitHub-hosted CRAN 
packages<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To recap the previous blog posts, I wrote two script:</p>
<ul>
  <li>one that automatically initializes the RcppDeepState-action on a list of 
preset GitHub repositories that included problems according to Akhila’s 
article<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This test were ran within the forked version of the repository to 
ensure that there were no permission issues with the GitHub tokens<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>;</li>
  <li>the other one that automatically replicates the RcppDeepState reports as a 
comment on the remote repositories<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using this method, I was able to identify a number of new issues with the 
RcppDeepState library. The most problematic one I discovered was that 
RcppDeepState would not build the shared object file in some circumstances due 
to missing dependencies in the tested packages. The incorrect usage of 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R CMD INSTALL</code> inside the package to build the shared object file without first
installing the missing package dependencies caused this issue. This problem was 
also reported to me by Dr.Martin R. Smith, author of numerous R packages 
accessible on CRAN, like <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Quartet/index.html">Quartet</a> 
and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TreeSearch/">TreeSearch</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, while examining the TreeSearch package, Dr. Smith identified 
another issue:  one of its packages was not analyzed because some datatypes fell
outside of the list of datatypes supported by RcppDeepState. He asked if this 
was expected behavior, and I said yes, as well as providing him with a detailed 
description of the error’s motivation, as well as a link to the RcppDeepState 
wiki article on how to add support for a new datatype. Dr. Smith then made a 
pull request<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to the RcppDeepState repository, asking for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IntegerMatrix</code>
datatype to be added to RcppDeepState. Because of this, I was able to determine 
whether or not the method required to add support for a new datatype is properly
documented; based on the results, I can claim that Dr.Smith did an excellent job 
by following all of the wiki steps one by one.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, I can say with certainty that beta testing really helped me in 
determining what the issues are with RcpDeepStare. Specifically, because to this
new technique, I was able to collect feedback from beta testers, like in the 
case of Dr.Smith.</p>

<p>After performing beta tests on the binsegRcpp<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> package using 
RcppDeepState-action I discovered two issues.</p>

<p>The first is that the user need consent from a single maintainer with write 
access before running a workflow within a remote repository. This has been
demonstrated with my mentor through pull request 
<a href="https://github.com/tdhock/binsegRcpp/pull/16">tdhock/binsegRcpp#16</a>.
In fact, this is explicitly stated in the GitHub documentation<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To help prevent this, workflows on pull requests to public repositories from 
some outside contributors will not run automatically, and might need to be 
approved first. By default, all first-time contributors require approval to run 
workflows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this is not the only issue: the person who opens a pull request is not
permitted to use the remote repository’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GITHUB_TOKEN</code> to automatically add a 
comment in the pull request. The token is only valid inside the same repository. 
This is clearly explained in the GitHub docs<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you enable GitHub Actions, GitHub installs a GitHub App on your 
repository. The GITHUB_TOKEN secret is a GitHub App installation access token. 
You can use the installation access token to authenticate on behalf of the 
GitHub App installed on your repository. The token’s permissions are limited to
the repository that contains your workflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="workaround">Workaround</h2>
<p>The primary purpose is to run RcppDeepState-action on CRAN packages available on
GitHub and share the findings with the package authors. To accomplish this task,
the following steps can be used as a workaround for the previous issues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>fork the remote repository;</li>
  <li>Create a self-pull request(from fork to fork) in the forked repository to 
examine the package using RcppDeepState-action;</li>
  <li>If RcppDeepState finds at least one error, make a pull request on the remote 
repository(from fork to upstream);</li>
  <li>Copy and paste the RcppDeepState report from the forked repository’s pull 
request into the pull request of the remote repository.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>According to the script that automatically forks and opens a self pull request
written in the previous blog post<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, we can write a script that, after the 
RcppDeepState-action workflow is done, opens a remote pull request on the
original repository and copies and pastes the RcppDeepState report within the
remote pull request.</p>

<p>The first step is to import the required libraries and get the GitHub personal 
access token (PAT) stored in an environment variable called GITHUB_PAT in my 
case. This token will be used to authorize the push of local commits to a 
repository’s remote branch. To generate this token, you can follow the 
instructions provided by GitHub<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">library</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"gh"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">library</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"git2r"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">library</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"data.table"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="n">cred</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cred_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"GITHUB_PAT"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">batch_size</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">10</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># adjust the batch size</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">organization</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"RcppDeepState"</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, we have defined two additional parameters, one of which is the 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">batch_size</code> parameter, which limits the number of packages tested. This option
must be equivalent to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">batch_size</code> parameter used when executing the script
that forks and creates a pull request<sup id="fnref:4:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, or else some pull request will not be
submitted. Furthermore, we define the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">organization</code> parameter, which searches 
for forked repositories inside the organization provided in this parameter. This

<p>Before we execute the aforementioned script, we must first run the previous blog
post’s code<sup id="fnref:4:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to fork the original repository and create the RcppDeepState 
reports. Remember that the new repositories will be created within the 
organization specified in the relative variable, as described in the
<a href="https://fabriziosandri.github.io/gsoc-2022-blog/github%20action/2022/08/23/rcppdeepstate-beta-test.html#future-work">Future work</a>
paragraph of the previous blog post<sup id="fnref:4:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Following that, we can ensure that all reports for the repositories being

<p>I tested this script an hour after the automatic fork procedure had finished

missing library is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RcppParallel</code>:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-future-work">Conclusion and Future work</h2>
<p>With this article demonstrated how to add another step to the script that 
automatically forks and opens a pull request to the remote repositories. In this
manner, I used a workaround to address the issues described in the article’s 
introduction.</p>

<p>Future work will involve increasing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">batch_size</code> option to the
maximum supported value in order to detect issues in all of the packages 
identified by Akhila.</p>

<p>My mentor has assigned me an interesting task to begin working on this week: 
test the current RcppDeepState GitHub Action on GitHub-hosted Rcpp-based 
packages. Akhila, the previous RcppDeepState maintainer, had already conducted 
a similar task, however this was done locally rather than in the package 
repository. Here’s a list of all the <a href="https://akhikolla.github.io./packages-folders/">Rcpp-based packages where RcppDeepState found issues</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Now that RcppDeepState has been integrated with GitHub action, we can test more 
packages stored on GitHub; all we have to do is fork the original repositories, 
setup the action within them, and then make a pull request so that the action 
returns a comment with the analysis result. The main advantages of using 
RcppDeepState-action inside a repository are that it allows to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>dynamically check for issues inside packages using continuous integration;</li>
  <li>reduce the risk of code level bugs that can compromise the entire package;</li>
  <li>improve the quality of the final package by making it easier to detect subtler
bugs, receiving quick feedbacks and alerts if an error is detected;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, CRAN lists 18493 packages, 312 of which have problems, 
according to Akhila’s report<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Given this list of packages, the question is 
whether it is feasible to determine if a package is hosted on GitHub. If so, 
can RcppDeepState be run on this repository?</p>

<p>To begin with, the answer to the first question is yes, and my mentor 
Dr.Toby Dylan Hocking supplied me with a fantastic method that allows me to 
find the GitHub repository of a package by evaluating the package’s metadata 
available on CRAN.
This method is based on locating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://github.com</code> prefix inside the 
metadata of the package. More information on this technique is available in the
corresponding blog post<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The answer to the second question is affirmative; once we have a link to the 
repository, we can simply fork it, initialize RcppDeepState-action using the 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RcppDeepState::ci_setup()</code> method, and submit a pull request; RcppDeepState’s 
report will be displayed as a comment within the pull request. The problem here 
is that, given the number of packages listed in the previous step, doing these 
steps one by one is impractical; consequently, in this post, I propose a method 
for automating this process.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>The solution makes use of four libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>gh</em><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: a minimal client to access the REST API of GitHub;</li>
  <li><em>git2r</em><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>: an interface to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libgit2</code> library, which provides access to 
Git repositories with some basic commands;</li>
  <li><em>data.table</em><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>: a library to aggregate large data and run fast 
operations;</li>
  <li><em>RcppDeepState</em><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>: a package to fuzz test your R library’s C++ code in order 
to find more subtle bugs like memory leaks or even more general memory errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<p>The first step is to import the required libraries and get the GitHub personal 
access token (PAT) stored in an environment variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GITHUB_PAT</code> in my 
case. This token will be used to authorize the push of local commits to a 
repository’s remote branch. To generate this token, you can follow the 
instructions provided by GitHub<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>After successfully cloning the repository, a new branch for the RcppDeepState 
analysis can be created. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RcppDeepState</code> is the name of this new branch.</p>
<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">test_branch_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"RcppDeepState"</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following step is to determine if the repository includes a legitimate 
package. This is accomplished by checking the existence of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DESCRIPTION</code> 
file within the repository’s root: if this file exists, the repository includes 
a valid package that can be examined using RcppDeepState; otherwise, 
RcppDeepState cannot analyze the package.</p>
<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">file.exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file.path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"./"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">fork_result</span><span class="o">$</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"DESCRIPTION"</span><span class="p">))){</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can now use the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ci_setup</code> function to initialize the workflow file 
within the repository. This function accepts as input the location of the 
repository on the filesystem and a list of parameters corresponding to the 
action’s inputs. In this scenario, we’ve specified <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fail_ci_if_error=TRUE</code> to 
cause the CI process to fail if an error is discovered, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comment=TRUE</code> to 
print the report comment inside the pull request that will be produced in the 
following phase.</p>
<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">RcppDeepState</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">ci_setup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fork_result</span><span class="o">$</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">fail_ci_if_error</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">TRUE</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">comment</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">TRUE</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

<h3 id="final-script">Final script</h3>
<p>We get the following script by combining all of the previous steps with the 
solution supplied by my mentor. As you can see, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">batch_size</code> option has been 
introduced to allow you to choose the number of repositories to test. This 
option was added to prevent the creation of 115 repositories within your GitHub 
account.</p>

<h2 id="test">Test</h2>
<p>Before running the preceding script, I assumed that running it with a 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">batch_size</code> of 115(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nrow(pkg.repos$repo_full_name)</code>) would result in a massive
generation of repositories within my GitHub account.
As a preliminary solution, I set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">batch_size</code> argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>, which means
that just two packages will be examined. I explain a possible approach to avoid
this massive production of repositories under my GitHub user profile in the 
<a href="#future-work">Future work</a> paragraph.</p>

<p>The following repositories will be tested with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">batch_size</code> of 2:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ironholds/humaniformat">ironholds/humaniformat</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jMotif/jmotif-R">jMotif/jmotif-R</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Following the execution of the above script, two repositories will be 
automatically generated by forking the originals. If you go inside the 
repositories’ pull requests, you’ll see that a new pull request titled 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Analyze the package with RcppDeepState</code> has been automatically submitted.
After a few minutes, when the CI checks are completed, you will see a comment 
inside the pull request with the analysis result.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>The findings of the analysis are publicly available on Github, and they 
highlight some issues within the evaluated packages. If we compare the results 
to those discovered by Akhila<sup id="fnref:1:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, we can see that there are some similarities.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>Creating 115 repositories, as previously said, will result in a huge generation
of repositories within my GitHub account. This is not a problem solely because 
of the number of repositories, but if I need to remove all of them, I will 
undoubtedly have to write a script to do so; this can be a dangerous task if 
done in my current working environment (my user profile) because I may
accidentally specify the incorrect condition and end up deleting the wrong
repositories.</p>

<p>One possible solution is to create a Github Organization and instruct the above 
script to fork the repositories to a specific organization rather than to my 
GitHub account. This can be accomplished by passing an extra argument to the 
GitHub REST API: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">organization</code> parameter; this parameter must be set to the
organization’s name. The rest of the code will be left unchanged.</p>

<p>Sometimes it can happen that a function in your package cannot be analyzed
because of some datatypes falling outside of the set of supported one. 
In this scenario, RcppDeepState cannot create the test harness automatically, 
thus the user must supply it manually.</p>

<p>This blog post is meant to be a guide for the users who wants to provide a 
custom test harness to the RcppDeepState GitHub Action.</p>

<h2 id="custom-test-harness">Custom test harness</h2>
<p>Creating a custom test harness is a difficult operation that must be completed appropriately by adhering to the general test harness structure outlined in the dedicated blog post<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If the test harness is not properly designed, RcppDeepState will not be able to locate and perform the tests.</p>

<p>Before continuing to read this post, you should first read about the test harness structure that RcppDeepState accepts. The following snippet of code contains the harness file’s structure that the user must follow to correctly operate with RcppDeepState. All of this has already been mentioned in the the dedicated blog post<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="provide-the-test-harness-to-the-action">Provide the test harness to the Action</h2>
<p>Once you have created a custom test harness for your function you can provide it to the RcppDeepState GitHub Action by simply creating a subdirectory inside your package’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/inst/testfiles</code>, named as the function that is being analyzed. 
This folder will  contain the harness file that should be named as the function being analyzed plus the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_DeepState_TestHarness.cpp</code> suffix. RcppDeepState will look for existing test harness files and use them instead of generating new ones before performing the analysis step.</p>

<p>While doing so, keep in mind the naming standards allowed by RcppDeepState; otherwise, unexpected problems may occur.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>Assume that a package stored in the root of a repository has a function named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsupported_datatype</code> that needs to be analyzed with RcppDeepState. Suppose this function has a parameter whose type falls out of the supported datatypes: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rcpp::LogicalVector</code> datatype.</p>
<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;Rcpp.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// [[Rcpp::export]]</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">unsupported_datatype</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Rcpp</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">LogicalVector</span> <span class="n">param</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">param</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because the test harness cannot be built automatically, this function cannot be analyzed using RcppDeepState. As mentioned above, one solution to this problem is to manually generate the test harness.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, the user can create a custom test harness and save it in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/inst/testfiles/unsupported_datatype/unsupported_datatype_DeepState_TestHarness.cpp</code> 
location (relative to the repository’s root).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We saw in this post how to pass a manually created test harness to RcppDeepState-action.
This RcppDeepState feature allows developers to analyze functions with unsupported datatypes as arguments.</p>

<p>The list of supported datatypes maintained by RcppDeepState is used to automatically create test harnesses for functions whose supported datatypes fall within this list. This list was created using a frequency table of the top 100 Rcpp types found in CRAN packages<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The complete list of supported datatypes is provided below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rcpp::NumericVector</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rcpp::IntegerVector</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rcpp::NumericMatrix</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rcpp::CharacterVector</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arma::mat</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible for a function you want to analyze to have a parameter that is not on this list, in which case RcppDeepState will notify you that the function cannot be examined due to an unsupported parameter.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>We can't test the function - unsupported_datatype - due to the following datatypes falling out of the allowed ones: LogicalVector

Failed to create testharness for 1 functions in the package - unsupported_datatype
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This just indicates that the automatic procedure to create a test harness cannot be used, not that your function cannot be analyzed at all. The test harness must therefore be manually created together with its directory structure, and it must then be examined.
I’ll explain this procedure in this blog article.</p>

<h2 id="the-procedure">The procedure</h2>
<p>RcppDeepState involves two steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>generator</em>: automatically generates the harness and all the inputs</li>
  <li><em>runner</em>: analyze the package running each function given the inputs of the generator step</li>
</ul>

<p>The generator step cannot be used for a function whose inputs are not supported, so we must manually run the steps to construct the directory structure for this function. This can be done using the existing RcppDeepState functions.</p>

<p>Given the path of the package being analyzed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package_location</code> and the name of the function which datatypes fall out of the supported ones <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function_name</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deepstate_create_makefile</code> function can be used to generate the directory structure for the custom test harness:</p>
<div class="language-R highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">deepstate_create_makefile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">package_location</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">function_name</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If everything goes smoothly, you can begin creating the custom test harness for your function. The test harness file must be named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function_name_DeepState_TestHarness.cpp</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function_name</code>is the name of the function you want to analyze. You can use the following template as a reference.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>I want to provide an example of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsupported_datatype</code> function that can be found in the testSAN package<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This function uses a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogicalVector</code> as its single parameter, thus RcppDeepState will skip this function from the analysis.</p>

<p>To solve this I followed all the steps mentioned above. First of all I ran the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deepstate_create_makefile</code> function, remembering that I had to define the missing variables(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package_location</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function_name</code>):</p>

<p>At the end of this, a directory containing the following content has been created:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>unsupported_datatype

<p>Then I moved on and created the test harness file inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsupported_datatype</code> directory and I renamed this file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsupported_datatype_DeepState_TestHarness.cpp</code>. I followed the template provided above. This is the result:</p>

<p>In the previous week I successfully integrated the original Docker action with a composite one. The main result of this update is a more flexible action that makes possible to publish the analysis results on Github; this is possible by publishing an artifact file containing the inputs and adding comments to pull requests. In the past working week (Week 7) I discussed with my mentor Randy about this change and he suggested me to prebuild the entire action and upload it to Docker Hub, which is a service provided by Docker for sharing container images<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. In this blog post I describe the process that will be followed this week, in order to prebuild the Docker image and publish it to Docker Hub.</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>
<p>The actual execution time of the Action is about 15-30 minutes. A huge amount of this time is spent installing all the missing dependencies, which includes the R package, devtools, and so on. Installing each of these every time the action is triggered is useless. A better approach instead would be to prebuild the docker container and save the image so that it can be reused each time the action will be run. This can be accomplished by publishing the image on Docker Hub. What I expect from this improvement is a reduction of the amount of time spent installing the dependencies.</p>

<p>One last thing to think about is moving the devtools installation command from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entrypoint.sh</code> file to the Dockerfile so that it will be installed when the container is built.</p>

<h2 id="switch-to-a-prebuilt-docker-image">Switch to a prebuilt docker image</h2>
<p>The main idea is to replace the actual Action’s Dockerfile with a simple composite step that runs the image from Docker Hub.</p>

<p>In the actual implementation, every time the Action is triggered, a container is built in accordance with the Dockerfile, downloading each dependency one at a time, as you can see in the Dockerfile of the following sample.</p>
<div class="language-dockerfile highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="s"> ubuntu:latest</span>

<span class="c"># setup zoneinfo</span>

<span class="c">### Dependencies installation</span>

</span>                   libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev <span class="se">\

<span class="c"># Executes `entrypoint.sh` when the Docker container starts up</span>
<span class="k">ENTRYPOINT</span><span class="s"> ["/entrypoint.sh"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The new composite step will make use of the prebuilt image made available on Docker Hub. The dependencies are all installed in this image, so setting them up won’t take any time; the only overhead will be caused by downloading the prebuilt action. This is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action.yml</code> before the change.</p>

<p>After the change, it will look like this:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">...</span>

<span class="nn">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As you can see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkout</code> step has been removed, in fact there’s no need to download the Dockerfile and the related files(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/docker</code> folder). This solves the problem of specifying the branch name in the checkout step mentioned by Randy in the pull request #4<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. However this introduces a new problem: I have to decide which event should trigger the update of the image on Docker Hub. A possible solution for this problem is to update the image every time a new commit on the master branch occurs. The problem with this solution is that, if I make a pull request and want to test some new updates made on the docker image, I have to push the result on the master branch to trigger the update on Docker Hub.</p>

<h2 id="continuous-deploy-of-the-docker-image">Continuous deploy of the Docker image</h2>
<p>Each change to the Docker architecture must be reflected to the image published on Docker Hub. In order to make this process automatic and avoid to manually push the docker image to Docker Hub, as suggested by Randy, there is an existing GitHub Action that automatically builds and publishes Docker images to Docker Hub<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. This action can be integrated in the RcppDeepState-action repository inside a workflow’s job that is triggered every time a commit on the master branch occurs.</p>

<p>A token must be generated in order to publish the image to Docker Hub and authenticate the user before pushing the image on it. This token can be simply generated by going in Profile Settings &gt; Security &gt; Access Tokens &gt; New Access Token. A pop up will appear, asking for the permissions that will be assigned to this token; the value “Read, Write, Delete” is sufficient.</p>

<p>In order to prevent information theft, the token and the username should be kept as a repository secret. In the example above, the variables for the username and token are referred to as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOCKERHUB_USERNAME</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOCKERHUB_TOKEN</code> respectively. These parameters have been set in the Security &gt; Secrets &gt; Actions menu on the Settings tab of the repository.
Once they are defined, they can be used in the following way<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> $</code>.</p>

<p>In the fifth week of work I’ve created a first working prototype of the GitHub Action for RcppDeepState, based on the considerations that I published in the dedicated blog post<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Within this post, I discussed three different architectures that might be used when creating a GitHub Action. Among the three possibilities, I selected to develop a GitHub action based on Docker.</p>

<p>However, in the pull request for the Action’s initial prototype, I indicated the potential of switching from a Docker Action to a Composite Action<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“In the future, I’ll also think about if I can express this Action as a composite action.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="docker-system-motivation">Docker system motivation</h2>
<p>The key reason for using a Docker-based system is that it enables for the creation of a fully customized environment in which RcppDeepState will execute. This allows me to install only the essential tools and configure the environment such that RcppDeepState fits in. In particular the idea came by the fact that RcppDeepState requires that optimization options must be disabled in the system in order to work with it’s maximum performance. Furthermore, because RcppDeepState can only be executed on Linux-based computers, limiting it to a Docker system based on a Linux container is a reasonable option.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>However, not everything works well with the Docker system since it lacks the final user interaction. This is a crucial consideration because it is what the final user will see. If the user is unable to detect or rapidly identify the errors in a package, the entire Action will be useless. Using the docker architecture, the action can only print the results in the log in text format, without allowing the results to be uploaded as an artifact file and shared with other steps/jobs in the workflow.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Starting with this I searched for a solution to the problem and discovered that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actions/upload-artifact</code> allows to share the analysis findings with other jobs by publishing an artifact file. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actions/upload-artifact</code> would be handy for RcppDeepState since it may be configured to upload the analyzed package’s ‘inst/testfiles’ folder, which contains the inputs as well as the Valgrind outputs of the RcppDeepState execution.</p>

<p>The issue is that publishing an artifact file via the Docker system is a challenging operation. One possibility is to combine the present Docker system with a Composite Action to gain the benefits of both systems. Thus in this week of work(seventh week) I will integrate the existing docker system with a composite action. The primary action will be the composite one, and the docker action will be triggered by a composite step.</p>

<p>Continuous integration and Continuous delivery, also called CI/CD, are two useful methodologies that every developer have hear about. 
This terms refers to the possibility of continuously perform some task with your code in an automated way.</p>

<p>Continuous integration, often, relies on executing automatic testing to check that an application is correctly behaving. On the other hand, continuous delivery refers to the process of automatically move the code from a testing environment to a production environment.</p>

<p>These two methodologies, can be implemented in any Git repository using tools such as GitHub Actions and TravisCI. I will focus only on GitHub Actions, which is a feature implemented by the GitHub platform, which allows to create complex workflows in any kind of repository.</p>

<h4 id="github-actions">GitHub Actions</h4>
<p>GitHub actions are fully integrated with GitHub and can respond to any specified GitHub event (new issue, pull request, push on a branch). This is a fully automated engine and GitHub Actions comes with a lot of pre-defined workflows that are provided by communities. A powerful functionality provided by GitHub actions is the possibility to run the code on different operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, macOS and Docker containers.</p>

<p>GitHub Actions are composed of three components: an event, a workflow and an action. Everything start with an event that triggers the execution of a workflow, which is composed of different jobs to compute some operations. Actions instead are reusable units of code that are called within a workflow with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> parameter.</p>

<h2 id="github-actions-and-rcppdeepstate">Github Actions and RcppDeepState</h2>
<p>In the previous posts, I demonstrated the efficacy of RcppDeepState in detecting issues in Rcpp-based libraries. Based on this, in order to make it easier for developers to execute RcppDeepState on any R package hosted in a GitHub repository, it will be useful to integrate RcppDeepState inside a GitHub Action.
This is exactly the main goal of my Google Summer Of Code project, but before getting started on the development of the GitHub Action, there are a few things to take into account.</p>

<h4 id="considerations">Considerations</h4>
<p>Here is a list of considerations that will help me during the development of the RcppDeepState GitHub Action.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first thing I need to take into account is the choice of the architecture for the GitHub Action. According to the GitHub documentation<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> there are three ways to create an Action:
    <ul>
      <li>Docker container Action</li>
      <li>Javascript Action</li>
      <li>Composite Action</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>While developing the Action I need to consider that all the optimization parameters must be disabled in order to get the best performance of RcppDeepState. The motivation behind this choice is explained in the <a href="https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState/issues/8">Issue #8</a>.</li>
  <li>Define the inputs and the outputs of the Action.</li>
  <li>The Action will likely be published on the GitHub Marketplace in the future so that developers can easily find it on the GitHub platform. As a result, I decided it would be better to build it in a different repository. This will, as stated in the documentation<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, decouple the versioning of the action from the versioning of the RcppDeepState application code.
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you’re developing an action for other people to use, we recommend keeping the action in its own repository instead of bundling it with other application code. This allows you to version, track, and release the action just like any other software.</p>

      <p>Storing an action in its own repository makes it easier for the GitHub community to discover the action, narrows the scope of the code base for developers fixing issues and extending the action, and decouples the action’s versioning from the versioning of other application code.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

<p>While searching for a way to perform non deterministic fuzz testing (using some kind of seeds) to be used in the workflow for the <a href="https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/RcppDeepState/pull/6">pull request #6</a>, I discovered that the seed would not work if the RInside declaration is made inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TEST</code> macro of the test Harness.
Let’s have a look at an example.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Recall to the example of the previous post, where we wanted to perform fuzz testing on a simple Rcpp function that takes an integer vector as input and returns the first element. 
Let’s say we want to discover a seed that will allow us to replicate the DeepState inputs throughout several executions, in a way that the execution will be deterministic. Let’s add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cout</code> at line 36 in order to observe the inputs generated by DeepState.</p>

<p>The result will change across several executions regardless of whether this harness is executed using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--seed=1</code> argument.
The first ten lines of output from two distinct runs are shown below, and it appears that the seed option has no influence on the produced input.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>This peculiar behavior, I discovered, is caused by the RInside statement within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TEST</code> macro. The seed will work if the above program is modified by shifting the RInside declaration to the beginning and deleting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code> keyword.</p>
